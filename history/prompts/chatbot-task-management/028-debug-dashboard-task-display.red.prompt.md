## PROMPT

When we asked the chatbot to add a task, it was added correctly to both the database and the UI. Then, in the chat, listing the tasks worked fine. However, when we went back to the dashboard, the task was no longer visible there, even though it still existed in the database. This means the dashboard only shows the task once and does not persist or refresh the data properly.

## RESPONSE

I have added debug logs to the dashboard's task fetching function. Please restart your frontend server, then open your browser's developer console (usually F12) and navigate to the dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard`). Look for messages like "Fetching tasks for userId:" and "Fetched tasks:" to see what data is being retrieved.
