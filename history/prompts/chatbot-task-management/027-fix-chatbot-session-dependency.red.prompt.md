outcome: "Fixed `TypeError: 'generator' object does not support the context manager protocol` in chatbot's `add_task` by refactoring `task_tools.py` functions to accept a `Session` object directly and updating the `chat` endpoint to provide it. Instructed the user to restart the backend server."

## PROMPT

The chatbot is not responding at all.

## RESPONSE
