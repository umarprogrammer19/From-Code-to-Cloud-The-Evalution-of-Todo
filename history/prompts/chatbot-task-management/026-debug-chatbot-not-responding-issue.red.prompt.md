## PROMPT

Now the chatbot is not responding at all.

## RESPONSE

The `Failed to fetch` error typically means the frontend cannot reach the backend, or the backend is returning an error that the frontend cannot process. Since the chatbot is not responding at all, it's very likely an issue on the backend.

Please provide the full backend server logs that appear when you try to use the chatbot from the frontend. This will help me identify the specific error occurring on the backend.
