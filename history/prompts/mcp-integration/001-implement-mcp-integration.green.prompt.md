  Successfully implemented the MCP Server Integration feature by completing 22 out of 26 tasks. Created MCP tools infrastructure, implemented all required task management tools (add, list, update, delete, toggle completion), updated the chatbot to use MCP tools via a registry pattern, added configuration for MCP server connection, and maintained statelessness. The implementation follows the specification with proper validation, error handling, and integration with existing systems. Tasks T019, T020, and T025 remain for future completion along with documentation task T022.

outcome: "Successfully implemented core MCP integration with all required tools and chatbot updates."
evaluation: "Implementation completed with 22/26 tasks marked as complete. The core functionality is working as specified."
