// This configuration appears to be incorrect as it tries to connect to a database from the frontend
// For now, we'll provide a minimal configuration or comment that this needs to be restructured
// The proper approach would be to use the backend's JWT system or properly configure better-auth
// to work with a backend API

// Placeholder configuration - this file should not exist in the frontend if using backend auth
// Instead, the frontend should communicate with the backend's auth endpoints
